# Timepix_RasPi_sdk
Software development kit for Timepix acquisition on Raspberry Pi ARM32 architecture. There are several examples how to control and manage various TPX devices. My example is "high_energy_calibration.cpp" which should be used to acquire data for high-energy calibration on Timepix moving holder (irradiation with 241Am source).
